allow_anonymous true

# This file is used by the single mqtt broker defined in:
# - docker-compose.dev.yml
# - docker-compose.prod.yml
#
# By default, it's a single-node broker (good for local/dev).
# To run a real multi-region "cluster", you run ONE mqtt service per
# region (using this compose file) and then add bridge connections
# here that point to the other regions' brokers.
#
# Example for the us-east region:
# -------------------------------------------------------
# connection to-central
#   address mqtt-central.your-vpc.local:1883
#   topic proofmesh/# both 0
#
# connection to-west
#   address mqtt-west.your-vpc.local:1883
#   topic proofmesh/# both 0
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# In us-central and us-west you use the same pattern, with their own
# hostnames. Once those are in place, messages on proofmesh/# published
# in any region will be forwarded between brokers, and all validators
# will see the same command/result topics.
