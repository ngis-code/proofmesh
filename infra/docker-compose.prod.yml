# Production-oriented compose file.
# - Starts a small CockroachDB *cluster* and an MQTT broker for you, so you
#   don't have to bootstrap them manually.
# - Also allows overriding DB / MQTT hosts via env vars if you later point
#   this stack at managed multi-region clusters instead of the local ones.
# - This gives you a "batteries-included" prod-style environment from a single
#   `docker compose` command.

services:
  # CockroachDB node for THIS region.
  #
  # In a real multi-region setup you will:
  # - Run THIS compose file in us-east / us-central / us-west.
  # - Give each region its own hostname / address (via COCKROACH_ADVERTISE_ADDR).
  # - Set COCKROACH_JOIN so each node knows about the others.
  #
  # Example (east):
  #   COCKROACH_ADVERTISE_ADDR=cockroach-east:26257
  #   COCKROACH_JOIN=cockroach-east:26257,cockroach-central:26257,cockroach-west:26257
  #
  # When you do the same in the other regions with their own advertise addrs,
  # Cockroach will form ONE GLOBAL CLUSTER across those three nodes.
  #
  # If you don't set COCKROACH_JOIN, this will behave as a single-node cluster
  # (good enough for local / single-region prod).

  # MQTT broker for THIS region.

  # In dev / single-region, this is just a single Mosquitto instance.
  # In real multi-region, you run this same service in each region
  # (so you get one broker per region) and configure mosquitto.conf
  # with bridge/cluster "connection" blocks that point to the other
  # regions' brokers so they share proofmesh/# topics.
